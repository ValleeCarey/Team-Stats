# Team-Stats

This javascript program create and extract information from my favorite sport teams. 

Each player name is printed as well as their age by using getter methods and functions.

Once created, I can manipulate these data structures as well as gain insights from them. 

For example, I may want to get the total number of games my team has played, or the average score of all of their games.
